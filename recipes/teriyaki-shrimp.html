            <li><strong>Honey:</strong> if you don’t have any honey, you may use brown sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice white vinager:</strong> this will taste better than the other vinegars but you can always improvise.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the shrimp:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> any other oil works, try sesame oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> use large and raw shrimp. Remove the tails if you prefer. If you don’t like shrimp, you may use chicken or tofu.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> any other oil works, try sesame oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Green onions:</strong> for garnishing and added flavor.</li>
